# Rosa Parks

Rosa Parks was born in Alabama. She was treated unfairly. She was cross. And one day Rosa had to give away her seat on the bus but she didn't and she went to
jail. She talked with her family and friends. All the black people agreed not to take the bus until things stopped being unfair.
